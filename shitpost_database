Sorry, Steven, we’ll get these centipeetles out of your room.
We think they were trying to get into the temple.
We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.
Steven, until you learn to control the powers in your gem, we’ll take care of protecting humanity, okay?
Well, we heard that too, and since they’re your favorite—
I went back and paid for them.
All that matters is that Steven is happy.
Calm down, Steven. Breathe, don't force it.
Oh, I'll go first!
Pay attention to these petals, Steven.
The petals' dance seems improvised, but it is being calculated in real time based on the physical properties of this planet.
With hard work and dedication, you can master the magical properties of your gem and perform your own dance!
Like so.
I don't think it works this way Steven.
Don't be silly, Steven.
Of course you are.
Steven, it's a shield!
What’s in these things?
Stay in the house, Steven!
We need to save Steven!
Of course they don't come from ice cream.
Don't worry, Steven, I'm sure some day you'll figure out how to activate your gem.
Look at the size of it, I had no idea these things were so big!
We saw.
Some of us are trying to protect humanity.
Where were you?
NOT awesome!
It's a Red Eye!
It’s going to crash into Beach City and crush us, along with a bunch of oblivious, innocent people!
We have to stop it.
I know, but she’s not, and the cannon is missing.
We’ll have to find another solution.
Greg is... nice, Steven, but I doubt Rose would entrust someone like him with such a powerful weapon.
AMETHYST!
... Okay, good luck.
He really had it!
I don’t know how it works, it was Rose’s!
Steven, this is serious.
The gem.
You have Rose’s gem.
It’s no use.
That’s not going to work.
It’s working!
Steven!
How did you get it to work?
That thing about pork rinds?
Amethyst, we do not need that!
It's not going to fit in the fridge!
We fought a giant bird.
We're only here for a second, we've got to go back out.
We have to place this Moon Goddess Statue on the top of the Lunar Sea Spire before midnight.
Without it, the whole place will fall apart!
Oh, Steven, you should have seen the spire in its heyday.
It was an oasis for Gems on Earth.
It's abandoned now, but we can still save it with this statue!
What? Why?
A hamburger?
Yes, so you should let us take care of it.
But you've still got a lot to learn.
Hmm, alright. 
You can carry it in your hamburger.
Steeeven, let's gooo!
Woah, Steven, did you bring your whole room?
Do you remember how to do this?
Keep your head in.
Come on.
It wasn't like this a hundred years ago.
Gah, Steven!
Alright, hold on.
We're taking Steven back!

This place is your heritage.
I want you to stay and help, but you really got to take this seriously!
Can you do that, Steven?
Yesss...
So we can't jump?
Wait!
Don't ever do that again!
But it was pretty great.
Oh, no, no, no, this is even worse than the outside.
Ugh... that's... oh!
Oh, this didn't used to be so—
Oh, and the water damage.
This pillar...
Oh, and this had a head...
Oh, Steven, once the statue's in place, it'll restore all of this to its former glory— aaah!
Crystal Shrimp.
It's an infestation.
And we have to pass through there to get to the top.
Don't touch that, their shards are deadly!
We need to clear a path.
Amethyst, if you go around to the side and disturb them with a spin attack...
And Garnet, if you move to the ceiling and strike this exact spot... then I can advance with my...
Uh, uhh, how did you know that would work?
I just want everyone to know: my plan would have also worked.
Oh, alright.
Cheeseburger backpack!
Steven, that's so sensible!
This is it.
The Moon Goddess pedestal.
And the moon is almost overhead!
It's not too late to save this piece of history!
What?!
There's... there's no time...
No, Steven, the Spire was falling apart when we got here.
You handled everything well under pressure.
You did great!
Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack!
Oh, Amethyst, there you are.
Care to explain what one of my swords was doing in your room?
Oh please, you took it!
It’s fine.
It’s in the past, I forgive you.
Also, I cleaned up your awful, awful mess.
You’re welcome.
What’s the matter, Steven?
Ah, that’s nice.
Hmm, there we go.
Ah.
Steven!
What are you doing in here?
You know it’s dangerous for you inside the temple.
What?!
Get out of there!
Steven!
Steven, there you are!
Oh, oh!
Steven, be careful!
You really shouldn’t be in here, this is the Crystal Heart.
Oh!
It’s connected to the most dangerous areas of the temple!
Hold on tight, and don’t look down.
Steven, we’re getting you out of here.
It’s taken refuge in organic matter!
Aah!
It’s horrible!
I know I had eight...
Hey, Steven, have you seen a Gem Shard anywhere?
It’s very important.
I’m serious, Steven.
These Shards have a powerful partial consciousness that has been harnessed by Gems throughout history in order to create semi-sentient drone soldiers with the capacity to follow basic orders.
Gems once created an army of these drones, but found their obedience waned as the shards overdeveloped inside their uniforms and turned on their commanders.
You see, any shard imprinted by any sort of container could become a monster.
That’s why it’s very, very important it’s kept away from any kind of garment...
If you see it, bring it to me, right away.
I’m going to check in town.
Steven!
Did you put my missing shard in that fry costume?
Didn’t you hear what I said about the living armor and infantries and many, many deaths?!
Oh Steven.
Ugh, the ketchup!
It’s everywhere, I can’t see!
Wah?
Steven?
Where?!
Steven, are you alright?
Weren’t people scared of it before he attacked them?
Put your clothes on, Steven.
Amethyst, you're overdoing it.
Just because you can shapeshift, doesn't mean you should.
Well of course-
All Gems have shapeshift powers, Steven.
We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies or... we could do that.
Don't bite off more than you can chew, Steven.
Ugh!
Steven!
Steven, what's going on?
We have to stay and help Steven!
Amethyst, I blame YOU for this.
Grrr!
Steven, just try to stay calm!
Steven!
Okay, let me see it.
W-?
Y-you got them to go away?
It just goes to show, always listen to me, and never listen to Amethyst.
Hahahahaha...
I don't think they are earthquakes, they're too frequent!
In the sand?
Who were you talking to?
Let's set up a play-date!
I'll write up an invitation and work out a schedule.
Ohh!
We'll have to find out her favorite kind of tea...
Funky flow?
Steven, what's going on?!
What did you do?!
Steven was so excited to meet you.
Right Steven?
Steven come on, you’re gonna make yourself sick.
Why did you bring that?
Steven get back here!
You could get seriously-
... Hurt!
Steven!
Are you-
I’m suddenly having second thoughts about bringing Steven on this mission...
Unbelievable, this was once a Gem battlefield, now it's wild strawberries as far as the eye can see!
Oh, that’s what I love about the Earth!
Maybe this will be a light mission after all.
Oomph.
Whatever it is, you probably shouldn’t touch it.
Steven!
What have we told you about touching magical things?
Right.
Steven and I will stay right here where it seems to be safe, while you guys go and solve the mystery of this place.
No, no no no-no-no.
You two are a disaster waiting to happen.
Wha-?
Oh, yes, of course.
But this could be the teacups all over again.
Garnet, there you are!
The doors and rooms here make no sense, they all bring you here!
There are sixteen doors, and we entered from the northeast and went through three consecutive rooms in a straight line...
But arrived back here out the southern-most door, which could only mean... well, I don’t know what it means!
I—
This is a death trap!
Steven.
Oh Steven, I-I didn’t really mean that.
This is unbelievable!
This Gem-powered mechanism!
It's manipulating the rooms above.
Every room we entered spun us until we came back to the central chamber!
It’s just like the teacups ride at Funland!
Oh...
Steven?
Steven?!
Where is he?
Ah, I’d say you handled that adventure very well.
How could you possibly think punching a blood polyp was a good idea?
Look at all the gunk you got on me!
And look at Steven!
He certainly won't like it when it hardens.
He shouldn't have been so close in the first place.
You're always putting us in danger with your little outbursts!
Ugh, you are just... so... childish!
I think we really got through to her!
Right, Garnet?
What are WE doing?
What is THIS?
No you don't!
This match is cancelled!
"Why"?!
I can't believe you've been sneaking off to this... this circus of violence!
And you!
Using your Gem powers on humans?!
We're not here to fight.
That's right!
Um... we wanna stop all wrestling everywhere!
Are you going to let us destroy all wrestling?
Hee-huh?
It'll be safer if you stand up and walk.
It's building columns with no roofs, stairs that go nowhere!
This is out of control!
That was a bit unnecessary.
Excuse me?!
We'll be quick.
Amethyst, bubble it away.
I'm not jealous.
Just be careful, if you drop it on the sand it'll rebuild everything!
Steven!
What is that?
What are you doing?!
That's impossible.
Get your hands out of that thing's mouth.
We have to get the Desert Glass out of the desert.
Amethyst, that pillow needs to be contained.
Steven!
The Desert Glass, it's rebuilding its castle.
Why didn't you bubble it earlier?!
Don't move, we're coming!
We gotta get through before things get any-
We should've done this in the first place.
Are we really going to let him keep that?
Oh, oh ho ho, "kept Amethyst", oh Garnet, that's priceless!
Steven!
This is a stealth mission!
You're making too much noise!
Take off the jacket!
Then why are you still wearing sandals?
C'mon then.
Steven!
Steven!
Steven!
Look!
The little ones didn't explode.
They're drilling away!
Sounds like you have something in mind.
Do we have anything else to do?
Humans find such fascinating ways to waste their time.
If you say so.
Road Killer?
W-well, which one of these buttons is my turn signal?
Okaaay...
Stop saying that!
Why am I doing so badly?
I haven't crashed into anything!
What?
That's horrible.
If we're suppose to fight a "giant foot", Garnet would let us know.
Well, we're all a team.
Garnet just has heightened perception that guides us towards our mission objective.
She's not "fighting the foot".
You know, Garnet goes off on missions without us all the time.
She's probably doing something very important.
There is no foot!
Ugh!
Steven!
They're everywhere, why didn't we see this coming?!
We don't know where she is!
Steven, where are you going?!
Wow, Amethyst, I'm impressed.
Steven, are the water balloons really necessary?
But it's checkers!
Every single move matters.
I'm not a sore loser, because I just won the game.
Ahem, I certainly hope that's not the same attitude you have during battle.
We don't form Opal because you're difficult and a mess.
Is water just hydrogen and oxygen "mashed" together? 
... Analogy wasted.
Look here, Steven.
When we synchronize our forms we can combine into a powerful fusion gem named Opal.
Amethyst?!
What Amethyst is attempting to say is, Opal is an amalgam of our combined magical and physical attributes fused into a single entity.
We only form Opal when it's absolutely necessary.
So, was your mission a success?
Well that's perfect because I don't want to go with grammatically incorrect people anyway.
What?
Why?
You mean more boring.
Ugh!
Come on, you two, let's go.
Apparently.
Come on, Steven.
No.
Ugh, Steven, we only fuse for deadly situations, does this look like a deadly situation?
Ow!
Hey, bad mountain goat!
Wait, Steven!
I'm not sure you can make those jumps.
We don't need Opal to get across.
It's just where Garnet said it would be.
The Heaven Beetle should be inside.
But where's the beetle?
It's supposed to be here, the heaven beetle wouldn't leave, would it?
Oh, it could be anywhere!
I can't believe your attitude, Amethyst.
And now you're just slouching over here doing nothing.
I don't squawk!
THIS is squawking! SQUAWK, SQUAWK!
It swallowed my spear!
Well, it would have worked if your movements weren't so erratic and formless.
Steven!
Stay low.
All you wanna do, is see me turn into—
I don't have it.
Amethyst, you got distracted!
How can you live like this?
Whining?!
The whole temple reeks!
What matter of magical alloy is this?
Oh Steven, that is us.
They are old timey people.
Much older than any human.
No, no.
We don't age, but we can still get hurt and die. ... but not from food poisoning.
Um, Steven?
I know you put a lot of effort into... putting faces on things.
But could it be that we're just a tad mature for this ritual?
GAH!
You will remove that this instant!
How?
I never did that.
Steven, are you telling lies?
I DO like pie.
Yes, me too.
Woah, Steven, I've got you.
Be careful, you almost fell right on that-
Ah!
I think this is why aging makes humans DIE!
Nothing against children.
Are you okay?
You know, Steven was right, this is fun.
Steven!
What's wrong with him?
Gems can't die from aging, but he's half human.
I can't!
Oh, look, I have what, um, what appears to be a delicious pie.
I sincerely hope nothing happens to-
Oh Steven!
Garnet?!
Wait a minute, what are you doing?!
Wha-?
Your age is fluctuating, I think your gem is reacting to your state of mind.
You have to feel like your self!
Sweet and considerate and only occasionally obnoxious!
Oh Steven!
Steven!
This doesn't look good at all.
You have to be careful, Steven!
Rose Quartz used to climb that hill every spring and tend to the moss at the top.
But now that Rose... is gone, the moss is on the move!
Yes, but Rose loved it anyway.
She saw the beauty in everything, no matter how gross.
Fortunately, I know just what to do in this situation.
Twooooh!
Haaaaaah!
Isn't this great?
This way, we don't even have to use magic.
Humans will just see this and walk away.
♪La la-la la-la Perfect!♪
Now we can come up with a plan to move the moss back to its hill!
What's that I hear?
You can't find one of your little men in that super junky room of yours.
E-hm.
You left your window wide open for things to just fly in and out.
Then, why haven't you found my magic axe?
Amethyst, go and find it right this second.
There's no way I'm going into that dump!
Is everything okay, Steven?
This is ridiculous.
How did he get my Replicator?
Can you please explain this mess?
Steven, why didn't you just replicate Ranger Guy?
What did he shoot?
I'm never letting Amethyst borrow anything again.
Garnet!
Yep.
Oh come on, it was so obvious.
He's been mopping in the background of every fight scene.
Look, here he is on the cover of the box.
Oh come on, this is ridiculous.
Just look at their form, this is nothing like real sword fighting.
Well, if you ever want to see a demonstration of proper sword techniques, I'd be happy to show you.
Now?
Alright, in order to give a proper demonstration I'm going to need a sparring partner.
Luckily, I have the perfect candidate right here.
Let this be the perfect battle.
We shall let our swords decide.
Oh-hoho, well, one does try their best.
Alright, but we should start with the basics.
Initiate, training mode.
I want you to stand back Steven, and watch me carefully, okay?
Do you see what I'm doing with my feet, Steven?
Notice where I keep my center of gravity.
Steven, you know that's not a real technique.
Steven, these are real sword techniques.
Not those silly things from your movies.
It's about waiting carefully for the perfect moment to-
W-whoopsie-daisy!
Steven, it's okay. I'm gonna be just-
Ah, that's much better.
Oof, hey, miss me much?
Uh, Steven. What happened to your room?
I don't even want to know what happened to you.
Steven, what are you doing?
I can't leave you guys alone for a second.
Oh!
Well, hello, Connie!
What a surprise to see you!
Uggh!
You okay, Steven?
Oh, walk it off!
Let's show this thing what we're made of, guys!
Duck!
Amethyst!
Smacking it really far away doesn't solve anything!
We needed to destroy it.
Now it's just gonna come back later.
Ugh!
No accolades for you, Amethyst!
She knocked the pufferfish back out into the ocean!
Oh, uhhh, that's okay.
Right now we have to figure out a way to take care of that pufferfish.
Got everything ready for your little party?
What's wrong with what we have on now?
Pearl!
Circus act?
Well, the temple has been here for thousands of years—
But, Steven, won't our abilities give us an unfair advantage?
There is no way I'd lose to someone like you!
Nice one, Kiki!
Nicely done, Kiki!
That was uncalled for, Amethyst!
There's nothing wrong with trying to keep tidy.
Amethyst!
Aah...
Over here, Amethyst!
Over here!
Cheaters!
Oh my gosh!
Steven!
Yes, ma'am!
With pleasure.
What were we banned from again?
Good afternoon, Steven.
That's so thoughtful, Steven.
Unfortunately though, uhh...
We'll bring you something back!
Hey, Steven!
We're baaaack!
Isn't it neat?
It uses high-frequency sound waves as a message relay...
...Between two fixed points!
Amethyst, I told you not to turn it on the house!
Rose's door.
Steven, your gem is opening your mother's room...!
Steven, wait!
STEVEN!
AGHUUHH!
It can't handle a task like that!
Thank goodness you're okay!
Oh Steven, we're sorry, too.
Amethyst, we could be here all day taking out these pillars individually.
What we need is a well thought out plan—
Whaaat?!
Wait!
Garnet, think about this.
You and Amethyst can be a little... eheh... unstable when your personalities combine.
We need to be careful!
Fuse with me, instead.
Steven, I think we should go.
Watch it!
Steven!
Ugh, you're just too much!
Steven, we're going!
She can find her own way home!
No.
Steven, what on earth are you up to?
You know, maybe this isn't a good idea.
There are different ways of being strong...
I'd rather not.
Why do you have to look up to her
Aside from in a literal sense?
Don't you know that a power that big
Comes with a bigger expense?
And can't you see that she's out of control
And overzealous?
I'm telling you for your own good,
And not because I'm- 
I can show you how to be strong...
In the real way.
And I know that we can be strong
In the real way.
And I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock
And when I talk
It lights a fire in you
I don't understand.
Amethyst and Garnet still aren't back yet.
I tried to warp back and check on them, but the Warp Pad's down!
Wha!
Y-you're back!
We just thought you didn't need any help.
Now why don't you separate, and we can all sit down and relax?
Listen to me!
You've been fused for too long!
You're losing yourselves!
Steven, get out of here!
You'll thank me... Later!
Steven!
I'm sorry...
Steven, Garnet, Amethyst...
I wasn't strong enough, to protect you.
I'm not strong enough to do anything...
I can't...
Any time! You're no match for me! Not even close!
Amethyst!
Garnet!
Are you okay!?
Whoops.
Thanks.
You make a good coach.
Yeah.
I was right.
Come on!
I feel great!
Who's up for a mission?
What one?
Steven, the legendary glass of time won't be nearly so small and insignificant.
It'll be beautiful and grand.
Like this one!
You mean the biggest one?
How are even supposed to get that back to the Warp Pad?
Wait!
We need to be careful which one we touch, you remember what happened last time we were here.
Amethyst!
Amethyst, come on!
W-Where do you think you're going?!
Steven!
Steven, come on!
Well done Garnet!
Unfortunately... we'll have to wait another hundred years for the sea shrine to reform because somebody couldn't keep their hands to themselves.
Huh?
EEEHHHH!
Three!
One more attack should do it.
Now there's nothing standing between us and the Shooting Star.
We've got to get Steven out of here!
Garnet, no!
Garnet!
Steven!
Get away from that thing!
This was a terrible idea!
And he's even managed to pop a bubble, and let out that awful... thing!
If that thing hurt you, so help me I'll !-
Excuse me?!
You can't be serious!
Well, let's at least take some precaution.
Absolutely not!
Garnet!?
But we have to go back for the shooting star!
Woah, why isn't that thing on its rock?
Steven, you can't just-
Steven, this is unacceptable!
Oh, no!
Out of the question! 
Well we can't return to the Ice Cavern now.
We have to deal with Steven and his... situation.
I just don't know if this will work...
Shooting Star, here we come...
Woah.
There it is!
The Shooting Star!
An ancient elemental, so hot, and so volatile, it can only be contained in ice.
Bare skin cannot endure its intensity!
Garnet, you'll have to use your gauntlets as not to hurt your hands.
Steven!
I knew this would happen!
Who knows?
Maybe when you have better control of your powers, you might help them in ways even your mother couldn't.
Steven!
You can bubble Gems!
Amethyst!
Show me your gem!
Amethyst!
Your gem is cracked!
How did this even happen?
Of course...
How could I have been so blind?
We need to put a fence up there, so this will never happen again!
It'd be fine if it was just her body, but her gem is damaged.
Before... we had Rose.
Just today, you were crying about snakes.
And in the center of the garden, Rose's Fountain, overflowing with your mother's healing, lacrimal essence!
Wha...
Now, now!
Let's keep it together!
Our memories of Rose can't be tainted by some overgrown brambles!
Look at them.
They're a mess without her guidance.
Directionless, pathetic, clinging things.
It's going to be okay, Garnet.
Y-you really think so?
Hmm...
Maybe there's a path over here!
Amethyst, no more roughhousing, you'll exacerbate your crack!
Ohh!
Oh!
Keep calm.
What we need to do is to get you into the fountain immediately, if we can ever find a way through all this mess!
We could've probably gotten in without hurdling a giant rock into Rose's most precious sanctuary!
But if you're okay with it, I'm fine, too!
What?
W-what's wrong with it?
Steven, it's fine.
Just— just stay here and watch Amethyst.
We'll find out what's wrong with the fountain.
Oh, thank goodness.
I'm pretty sure me and Garnet unplugging the clogged chamber brought the fountain back to life.
So, how do we begin our "school"?
Teach you?!
Steven!
If only I had known that's what you really wanted!
We found this Gem-powered mirror at the Galaxy Warp.
It can capture and display any event it's witnessed in all of Gem history.
It'll offer you everything you've ever wanted to know about your fellow Gems and our culture.
It's just you in there.
It hasn't even been activated.
Show us the Galaxy Warp...
Show us the Galaxy Warp.
Oh, come on!
I know you've seen it.
It is in pretty rough shape.
It must finally be broken.
What a shame.
Oh well.
I guess that's the end of our school.
Yes.
Good, Steven.
There are many ways to say the same thing.
The asymmetry of this pile is really starting to bother me.
Hello, Steven.
You don't understand.
Symmetrical means both sides have to be the same!
Oh, gosh!
Excellent work, Steven!
Wait.
What?
It's talking to him?
It shouldn't be able to do that.
I-it should just be following orders...
Garnet, wait!
I'm sure he didn't understand what he was doing!
Steven!
Steven, run!
Steven!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yes, you're grounded!
She's the Gem you released from the mirror.
There's a lot you don't know about Gems, Steven.
How could I have known the Gem contained in that mirror would be so powerful?
Clearly, we're coming too.
We're always fighting Gems, actually.
Oh, how do I put this?
All Gems aren't necessarily... good.
Yes.
But they've become corrupted and broken.
We have to take care of them, subdue them, contain them.
It's the best we can do for them, for now.
If we don't, then... 
I don't understand.
What does she want with the ocean?
Greg, kids, you stay behind us.
We'll handle this.
I hate fighting me.
Well, what's that thing you always say about the pork chops and the hot dogs?
What does this mean for us?
Wow.
Those water constructs really did a number on Greg's van.
I completely disagree.
It's just a simple human machine.
I'm sure that I can figure this whole thing out before you know it!
Is it some kind of complex human tool?
I'm sure that I can fix this without your tape.
 Yes!
Oh, right, yes!
You fix Greg, I'll fix the van, nobody has to live with us.
Steven, don't worry about it.
Your powers are a bit fickle, after all.
Garnet, can you give me a hand?
What? 
Now, Greg, there's no need to be so pathetic.
If anything happens to you, you can call us with this.
What you're looking at is a synthetic storm that was caused and contained in—
Is everything okay?
Like I was saying, this is a synthetic—
Okay, so if the Geode breaks, then the storm will be unleashed and our bodies will be vaporized. 
We'll find another way!
We have to come up with another plan, quick. 
So, I've realigned the axles, replaced the spark plugs, sealed the leaks in the intake manifold gaskets, and recalibrated the timing belt.
As long as you ease up on second gear, your transmission should be fine.
Inactive.
Well, Steven, these warp pads were used to travel off-planet.
They were our connection to the Gem Homeworld and to Gem-controlled planets all over the universe.
It's true.
The galaxy warps have all been inactive for thousands of years.
It's fine.
I'll always have my memories of other worlds.
But now I'm here... on Earth... forever.
Right.
With you.
It really is incredible out there, though.
I wish you could see it, Steven.
"UUU space travel"?
What is this?
A spaceship?
A spaceship.
Aah!
I think your calculations may have been off.
Did you really think this was gonna work?
Here, look.
You need smooth, curving surfaces.
Otherwise, you're never gonna get enough speed to break Earth's gravitational pull.
Probably swept-back wings for supersonic flight, airtight cockpit with ejector seat, and we'll need some serious engines, or maybe rockets would be better.
What?!
This?
Of course not.
That would be ridiculous.
I mean, yes, theoretically, it's not a stretch.
You've got plenty of spare parts here, albeit for incredibly primitive propulsion-based space travel.
The idea is ludicrous.
It would never work, although several humans, a monkey, and a dog did make it into space.
I don't know why I've never even thought of it before.
This could actually work!
I hear what you're saying, and I agree— it would be incredibly dangerous ; a fool's errand.
This chair is disgusting.
But aren't the true fools the ones who don't seize an opportunity, despite all the inherent risks?
And I'd be able to show Steven the wonders of the cosmos!
And maybe just for a second, from a distance, I could see what's been going on without me.
All right!
Let's do it!
We're not even close to being done.
Okay, Steven.
Go ahead and bring her down.
Don't worry.
This was just to test my engine concept.
I'll work out the kinks in the next one.
Is there a shop in town that carries F-1 single-nozzle liquid-fueled rockets?
Of course!
We're also going to need a space suit for Steven so he doesn't freeze or explode.
Yes, I am.
Hey!
Who made you C.E.O.?!
Fine.
If neither of you will help, I'll just do it by myself, not like it'll be much different.
Shh!
Want to see something really cool?
Presenting the brand-new ballistic-flight-capable Universe Mach 3!
Wait, Steven.
Keep your voice down.
And if your dad asks, we'll say we borrowed it.
If you want, Steven, we could take her out for an engine check.
It'll be quick.
This will be perfectly fine, just a pop over to the nearest star system.
I'll give him back in 50 years.
Oh, this is so exciting!
Steven, you're gonna love it.
Hang on tight!
We can make it.
We're almost there.
I'm gonna show it to you.
Steven!
What are you doing?!
But we're almost there!
I'm so sorry.
I almost got us killed.
You know, I think I'd rather be here on Earth.
Yeah.
With you.
What are you doing in here?!
I... just wanted to see how the shards are reacting to Rose's bubble.
And it's none of your business.
Don't tell her!
Heathen!
Steven, be careful with that!
She's not going to find out...
We're going to catch them, all of them.
Like nothing ever happened.
No!
This has to stay a secret.
Okay?
Fish Stew Pizza?
Greeaat, Steven.
Come on. We're doing this.
Okay.
Are you sure we didn't miss any?
If you're sure this is all of them, then we just need to seal it in a Rose Quartz bubble.
Of course you can!
You're part of the Secret Club!
Ah, yes, Secret Team.
Then what are you waiting for?
Mission accomplished.
Congratulations, us.
Now everything goes back to normal and we never speak of this again.
I've never seen you wear this.
Secret Team?
What's that?!
Steven, that was not about fun.
That was about fixing our terrible mistake.
It never would have popped if you hadn't invaded my personal space!
Good!
I don't want to be on a team with you, either!
Fine!
Garnet!
Steven!
Steven...
I can't believe you!
Amethyst, shape-shift!
Get small or... something!
I can't concentrate!
This is all my fault!
I never should have had that bubble!
What?



Oh, honestly, you call everyone a clod.
Ruby!
Sapphire!
We saw.
Baseball?!
Earl!
Nice!
Uh-oh...
What?
