Woah, what are you, crazy?!
An Electric Skull, our Crystal Palace was swarming with them.
No!
It’s extremely powerful, we shouldn’t have even brought it home.
You wanna sing that during battle?
Why?
You’ll look... like a clown!
Look Steven, you’re still too young to come with us.
You don’t even have powers in your gem.
Wh-why do you have that?
Why did you give him that!?
We’ve been protecting that Hourglass for a thousand years.
Now that it’s activated, it can only be used by you for its chosen purpose.
What did you use it for?
Comebacks?
You used it, for comebacks?
We’ve lead it right to us.
Oh, Steven, it can see the holes you’ve ripped in the fabric of time.
You’ll look, like a clown.
What the?
Sorry, Steven, we’ll get these centipeetles out of your room.
We think they were trying to get into the temple.
We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.
Steven, until you learn to control the powers in your gem, we’ll take care of protecting humanity, okay?
Well, we heard that too, and since they’re your favorite—
I went back and paid for them.
All that matters is that Steven is happy.
Calm down, Steven. Breathe, don't force it.
Oh, I'll go first!
Pay attention to these petals, Steven.
The petals' dance seems improvised, but it is being calculated in real time based on the physical properties of this planet.
With hard work and dedication, you can master the magical properties of your gem and perform your own dance!
Like so.
I don't think it works this way Steven.
Don't be silly, Steven.
Of course you are.
Steven, it's a shield!
What’s in these things?
Stay in the house, Steven!
We need to save Steven!
Of course they don't come from ice cream.
Don't worry, Steven, I'm sure some day you'll figure out how to activate your gem.
Look at the size of it, I had no idea these things were so big!
We saw.
Some of us are trying to protect humanity.
Where were you?
NOT awesome!
It's a Red Eye!
It’s going to crash into Beach City and crush us, along with a bunch of oblivious, innocent people!
We have to stop it.
I know, but she’s not, and the cannon is missing.
We’ll have to find another solution.
Greg is... nice, Steven, but I doubt Rose would entrust someone like him with such a powerful weapon.
AMETHYST!
... Okay, good luck.
He really had it!
I don’t know how it works, it was Rose’s!
Steven, this is serious.
The gem.
You have Rose’s gem.
It’s no use.
That’s not going to work.
It’s working!
Steven!
How did you get it to work?
That thing about pork rinds?
Amethyst, we do not need that!
It's not going to fit in the fridge!
We fought a giant bird.
We're only here for a second, we've got to go back out.
We have to place this Moon Goddess Statue on the top of the Lunar Sea Spire before midnight.
Without it, the whole place will fall apart!
Oh, Steven, you should have seen the spire in its heyday.
It was an oasis for Gems on Earth.
It's abandoned now, but we can still save it with this statue!
What? Why?
A hamburger?
Yes, so you should let us take care of it.
But you've still got a lot to learn.
Hmm, alright. 
You can carry it in your hamburger.
Steeeven, let's gooo!
Woah, Steven, did you bring your whole room?
Do you remember how to do this?
Keep your head in.
Come on.
It wasn't like this a hundred years ago.
Gah, Steven!
Alright, hold on.
We're taking Steven back!
Steven!
This place is your heritage.
I want you to stay and help, but you really got to take this seriously!
Can you do that, Steven?
Yesss...
So we can't jump?
Wait!
Don't ever do that again!
But it was pretty great.
Oh, no, no, no, this is even worse than the outside.
Ugh... that's... oh!
Oh, this didn't used to be so—
Oh, and the water damage.
This pillar...
Oh, and this had a head...
Oh, Steven, once the statue's in place, it'll restore all of this to its former glory— aaah!
Crystal Shrimp.
It's an infestation.
And we have to pass through there to get to the top.
Don't touch that, their shards are deadly!
We need to clear a path.
Amethyst, if you go around to the side and disturb them with a spin attack...
And Garnet, if you move to the ceiling and strike this exact spot... then I can advance with my...
Uh, uhh, how did you know that would work?
I just want everyone to know: my plan would have also worked.
Oh, alright.
Cheeseburger backpack!
Steven, that's so sensible!
This is it.
The Moon Goddess pedestal.
And the moon is almost overhead!
It's not too late to save this piece of history!
What?!
There's... there's no time...
No, Steven, the Spire was falling apart when we got here.
You handled everything well under pressure.
You did great!
Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack!
Oh, Amethyst, there you are.
Care to explain what one of my swords was doing in your room?
Oh please, you took it!
It’s fine.
It’s in the past, I forgive you.
Also, I cleaned up your awful, awful mess.
You’re welcome.
What’s the matter, Steven?
Ah, that’s nice.
Hmm, there we go.
Ah.
Steven!
What are you doing in here?
You know it’s dangerous for you inside the temple.
What?!
Get out of there!
Steven!
Steven, there you are!
Oh, oh!
Steven, be careful!
You really shouldn’t be in here, this is the Crystal Heart.
Oh!
It’s connected to the most dangerous areas of the temple!
Hold on tight, and don’t look down.
Steven, we’re getting you out of here.
It’s taken refuge in organic matter!
Aah!
It’s horrible!
I know I had eight...
Hey, Steven, have you seen a Gem Shard anywhere?
It’s very important.
I’m serious, Steven.
These Shards have a powerful partial consciousness that has been harnessed by Gems throughout history in order to create semi-sentient drone soldiers with the capacity to follow basic orders.
Gems once created an army of these drones, but found their obedience waned as the shards overdeveloped inside their uniforms and turned on their commanders.
You see, any shard imprinted by any sort of container could become a monster.
That’s why it’s very, very important it’s kept away from any kind of garment...
If you see it, bring it to me, right away.
I’m going to check in town.
Steven!
Did you put my missing shard in that fry costume?
Didn’t you hear what I said about the living armor and infantries and many, many deaths?!
Oh Steven.
Ugh, the ketchup!
It’s everywhere, I can’t see!
Wah?
Steven?
Where?!
Steven, are you alright?
Weren’t people scared of it before he attacked them?
Put your clothes on, Steven.
Amethyst, you're overdoing it.
Just because you can shapeshift, doesn't mean you should.
Well of course-
All Gems have shapeshift powers, Steven.
We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies or... we could do that.
Don't bite off more than you can chew, Steven.
Ugh!
Steven!
Steven, what's going on?
We have to stay and help Steven!
Amethyst, I blame YOU for this.
Grrr!
Steven, just try to stay calm!
Steven!
Okay, let me see it.
W-?
Y-you got them to go away?
It just goes to show, always listen to me, and never listen to Amethyst.
Hahahahaha...
I don't think they are earthquakes, they're too frequent!
In the sand?
Who were you talking to?
Let's set up a play-date!
I'll write up an invitation and work out a schedule.
Ohh!
We'll have to find out her favorite kind of tea...
Funky flow?
Steven, what's going on?!
What did you do?!
Steven was so excited to meet you.
Right Steven?
Steven come on, you’re gonna make yourself sick.
Why did you bring that?
Steven get back here!
You could get seriously-
... Hurt!
Steven!
Are you-
I’m suddenly having second thoughts about bringing Steven on this mission...
Unbelievable, this was once a Gem battlefield, now it's wild strawberries as far as the eye can see!
Oh, that’s what I love about the Earth!
Maybe this will be a light mission after all.
Oomph.
Whatever it is, you probably shouldn’t touch it.
Steven!
What have we told you about touching magical things?
Right.
Steven and I will stay right here where it seems to be safe, while you guys go and solve the mystery of this place.
No, no no no-no-no.
You two are a disaster waiting to happen.
Wha-?
Oh, yes, of course.
But this could be the teacups all over again.
Garnet, there you are!
The doors and rooms here make no sense, they all bring you here!
There are sixteen doors, and we entered from the northeast and went through three consecutive rooms in a straight line...
But arrived back here out the southern-most door, which could only mean... well, I don’t know what it means!
I—
This is a death trap!
Steven.
Oh Steven, I-I didn’t really mean that.
This is unbelievable!
This Gem-powered mechanism!
It's manipulating the rooms above.
Every room we entered spun us until we came back to the central chamber!
It’s just like the teacups ride at Funland!
Oh...
Steven?
Steven?!
Where is he?
Ah, I’d say you handled that adventure very well.
How could you possibly think punching a blood polyp was a good idea?
Look at all the gunk you got on me!
And look at Steven!
He certainly won't like it when it hardens.
He shouldn't have been so close in the first place.
You're always putting us in danger with your little outbursts!
Ugh, you are just... so... childish!
I think we really got through to her!
Right, Garnet?
What are WE doing?
What is THIS?
No you don't!
This match is cancelled!
"Why"?!
I can't believe you've been sneaking off to this... this circus of violence!
And you!
Using your Gem powers on humans?!
We're not here to fight.
That's right!
Um... we wanna stop all wrestling everywhere!
Are you going to let us destroy all wrestling?
Hee-huh?
It'll be safer if you stand up and walk.
It's building columns with no roofs, stairs that go nowhere!
This is out of control!
That was a bit unnecessary.
Excuse me?!
We'll be quick.
Amethyst, bubble it away.
I'm not jealous.
Just be careful, if you drop it on the sand it'll rebuild everything!
Steven!
What is that?
What are you doing?!
That's impossible.
Get your hands out of that thing's mouth.
We have to get the Desert Glass out of the desert.
Amethyst, that pillow needs to be contained.
Steven!
The Desert Glass, it's rebuilding its castle.
Why didn't you bubble it earlier?!
Don't move, we're coming!
We gotta get through before things get any-
We should've done this in the first place.
Are we really going to let him keep that?
Oh, oh ho ho, "kept Amethyst", oh Garnet, that's priceless!
Steven!
This is a stealth mission!
You're making too much noise!
Take off the jacket!
Then why are you still wearing sandals?
C'mon then.
Steven!
Steven!
Steven!
Look!
The little ones didn't explode.
They're drilling away!
Sounds like you have something in mind.
Do we have anything else to do?
Humans find such fascinating ways to waste their time.
If you say so.
Road Killer?
W-well, which one of these buttons is my turn signal?
Okaaay...
Stop saying that!
Why am I doing so badly?
I haven't crashed into anything!
What?
That's horrible.
If we're suppose to fight a "giant foot", Garnet would let us know.
Well, we're all a team.
Garnet just has heightened perception that guides us towards our mission objective.
She's not "fighting the foot".
You know, Garnet goes off on missions without us all the time.
She's probably doing something very important.
There is no foot!
Ugh!
Steven!
They're everywhere, why didn't we see this coming?!
We don't know where she is!
Steven, where are you going?!
Wow, Amethyst, I'm impressed.
Steven, are the water balloons really necessary?
But it's checkers!
Every single move matters.
I'm not a sore loser, because I just won the game.
Ahem, I certainly hope that's not the same attitude you have during battle.
We don't form Opal because you're difficult and a mess.
Is water just hydrogen and oxygen "mashed" together? 
... Analogy wasted.
Look here, Steven.
When we synchronize our forms we can combine into a powerful fusion gem named Opal.
Amethyst?!
What Amethyst is attempting to say is, Opal is an amalgam of our combined magical and physical attributes fused into a single entity.
We only form Opal when it's absolutely necessary.
So, was your mission a success?
Well that's perfect because I don't want to go with grammatically incorrect people anyway.
What?
Why?
You mean more boring.
Ugh!
Come on, you two, let's go.
Apparently.
Come on, Steven.
No.
Ugh, Steven, we only fuse for deadly situations, does this look like a deadly situation?
Ow!
Hey, bad mountain goat!
Wait, Steven!
I'm not sure you can make those jumps.
We don't need Opal to get across.
It's just where Garnet said it would be.
The Heaven Beetle should be inside.
But where's the beetle?
It's supposed to be here, the heaven beetle wouldn't leave, would it?
Oh, it could be anywhere!
I can't believe your attitude, Amethyst.
And now you're just slouching over here doing nothing.
I don't squawk!
THIS is squawking! SQUAWK, SQUAWK!
It swallowed my spear!
Well, it would have worked if your movements weren't so erratic and formless.
Steven!
Stay low.
All you wanna do, is see me turn into—
I don't have it.
Amethyst, you got distracted!
How can you live like this?
Whining?!
The whole temple reeks!
What matter of magical alloy is this?
Oh Steven, that is us.
They are old timey people.
Much older than any human.
No, no.
We don't age, but we can still get hurt and die... but not from food poisoning.
Um, Steven?
I know you put a lot of effort into... putting faces on things.
But could it be that we're just a tad mature for this ritual?
GAH!
You will remove that this instant!
How?
I never did that.
Steven, are you telling lies?
I DO like pie.
Yes, me too.
Woah, Steven, I've got you.
Be careful, you almost fell right on that-
Ah!
I think this is why aging makes humans DIE!
Nothing against children.
Are you okay?
You know, Steven was right, this is fun.
Steven!
What's wrong with him?
Gems can't die from aging, but he's half human.
I can't!
Oh, look, I have what, um, what appears to be a delicious pie.
I sincerely hope nothing happens to-
Oh Steven!
Garnet?!
Wait a minute, what are you doing?!
Wha-?
Your age is fluctuating, I think your gem is reacting to your state of mind.
You have to feel like your self!
Sweet and considerate and only occasionally obnoxious!
Oh Steven!
Steven!
This doesn't look good at all.
You have to be careful, Steven!
Rose Quartz used to climb that hill every spring and tend to the moss at the top.
But now that Rose... is gone, the moss is on the move!
Yes, but Rose loved it anyway.
She saw the beauty in everything, no matter how gross.
Fortunately, I know just what to do in this situation.
Twooooh!
Haaaaaah!
Isn't this great?
This way, we don't even have to use magic.
Humans will just see this and walk away.
♪La la-la la-la Perfect!♪
Now we can come up with a plan to move the moss back to its hill!
What's that I hear?
You can't find one of your little men in that super junky room of yours.
E-hm.
You left your window wide open for things to just fly in and out.
Then, why haven't you found my magic axe?
Amethyst, go and find it right this second.
There's no way I'm going into that dump!
Is everything okay, Steven?
This is ridiculous.
How did he get my Replicator?
Can you please explain this mess?
Steven, why didn't you just replicate Ranger Guy?
What did he shoot?
I'm never letting Amethyst borrow anything again.
Garnet!
Yep.
Oh come on, it was so obvious.
He's been mopping in the background of every fight scene.
Look, here he is on the cover of the box.
Oh come on, this is ridiculous.
Just look at their form, this is nothing like real sword fighting.
Well, if you ever want to see a demonstration of proper sword techniques, I'd be happy to show you.
Now?
Alright, in order to give a proper demonstration I'm going to need a sparring partner.
Luckily, I have the perfect candidate right here.
Let this be the perfect battle.
We shall let our swords decide.
Oh-hoho, well, one does try their best.
Alright, but we should start with the basics.
Initiate, training mode.
I want you to stand back Steven, and watch me carefully, okay?
Do you see what I'm doing with my feet, Steven?
Notice where I keep my center of gravity.
Steven, you know that's not a real technique.
Steven, these are real sword techniques.
Not those silly things from your movies.
It's about waiting carefully for the perfect moment to-
W-whoopsie-daisy!
Steven, it's okay. I'm gonna be just-
Ah, that's much better.
Oof, hey, miss me much?
Uh, Steven. What happened to your room?
I don't even want to know what happened to you.
Steven, what are you doing?
I can't leave you guys alone for a second.
Oh!
Well, hello, Connie!
What a surprise to see you!
Uggh!
You okay, Steven?
Oh, walk it off!
Let's show this thing what we're made of, guys!
Duck!
Amethyst!
Smacking it really far away doesn't solve anything!
We needed to destroy it.
Now it's just gonna come back later.
Ugh!
No accolades for you, Amethyst!
She knocked the pufferfish back out into the ocean!
Oh, uhhh, that's okay.
Right now we have to figure out a way to take care of that pufferfish.
Got everything ready for your little party?
What's wrong with what we have on now?
Pearl!
Circus act?
Well, the temple has been here for thousands of years—
But, Steven, won't our abilities give us an unfair advantage?
There is no way I'd lose to someone like you!
Nice one, Kiki!
Nicely done, Kiki!
That was uncalled for, Amethyst!
There's nothing wrong with trying to keep tidy.
Amethyst!
Aah...
Over here, Amethyst!
Over here!
Cheaters!
Oh my gosh!
Steven!
Yes, ma'am!
With pleasure.
What were we banned from again?
Good afternoon, Steven.
That's so thoughtful, Steven.
Unfortunately though, uhh...
We'll bring you something back!
Hey, Steven!
We're baaaack!
Isn't it neat?
It uses high-frequency sound waves as a message relay...
...Between two fixed points!
Amethyst, I told you not to turn it on the house!
Rose's door.
Steven, your gem is opening your mother's room...!
Steven, wait!
STEVEN!
AGHUUHH!
It can't handle a task like that!
Thank goodness you're okay!
Oh Steven, we're sorry, too.
Amethyst, we could be here all day taking out these pillars individually.
What we need is a well thought out plan—
Whaaat?!
Wait!
Garnet, think about this.
You and Amethyst can be a little... eheh... unstable when your personalities combine.
We need to be careful!
Fuse with me, instead.
Steven, I think we should go.
Watch it!
Steven!
Ugh, you're just too much!
Steven, we're going!
She can find her own way home!
No.
Steven, what on earth are you up to?
You know, maybe this isn't a good idea.
There are different ways of being strong...
I'd rather not.
Why do you have to look up to her, aside from in a literal sense?
Don't you know that a power that big comes with a bigger expense?
And can't you see that she's out of control and overzealous?
I'm telling you for your own good, and not because I'm- 
I can show you how to be strong... in the real way.
And I know that we can be strong in the real way.
And I want to inspire you, I want to be your rock.
And when I talk, it lights a fire in you!
I don't understand.
Amethyst and Garnet still aren't back yet.
I tried to warp back and check on them, but the Warp Pad's down!
Wha!
Y-you're back!
We just thought you didn't need any help.
Now why don't you separate, and we can all sit down and relax?
Listen to me!
You've been fused for too long!
You're losing yourselves!
Steven, get out of here!
You'll thank me... Later!
Steven!
I'm sorry...
Steven, Garnet, Amethyst...
I wasn't strong enough, to protect you.
I'm not strong enough to do anything...
I can't...
Any time! You're no match for me! Not even close!
Amethyst!
Garnet!
Are you okay!?
Whoops.
Thanks.
You make a good coach.
Yeah.
I was right.
Come on!
I feel great!
Who's up for a mission?
What one?
Steven, the legendary glass of time won't be nearly so small and insignificant.
It'll be beautiful and grand.
Like this one!
You mean the biggest one?
How are even supposed to get that back to the Warp Pad?
Wait!
We need to be careful which one we touch, you remember what happened last time we were here.
Amethyst!
Amethyst, come on!
W-Where do you think you're going?!
Steven!
Steven, come on!
Well done Garnet!
Unfortunately... we'll have to wait another hundred years for the sea shrine to reform because somebody couldn't keep their hands to themselves.
Huh?
EEEHHHH!
Three!
One more attack should do it.
Now there's nothing standing between us and the Shooting Star.
We've got to get Steven out of here!
Garnet, no!
Garnet!
Steven!
Get away from that thing!
This was a terrible idea!
And he's even managed to pop a bubble, and let out that awful... thing!
If that thing hurt you, so help me I'll !-
Excuse me?!
You can't be serious!
Well, let's at least take some precaution.
Absolutely not!
Garnet!?
But we have to go back for the shooting star!
Woah, why isn't that thing on its rock?
Steven, you can't just-
Steven, this is unacceptable!
Oh, no!
Out of the question! 
Well we can't return to the Ice Cavern now.
We have to deal with Steven and his... situation.
I just don't know if this will work...
Shooting Star, here we come...
Woah.
There it is!
The Shooting Star!
An ancient elemental, so hot, and so volatile, it can only be contained in ice.
Bare skin cannot endure its intensity!
Garnet, you'll have to use your gauntlets as not to hurt your hands.
Steven!
I knew this would happen!
Who knows?
Maybe when you have better control of your powers, you might help them in ways even your mother couldn't.
Steven!
You can bubble Gems!
Amethyst!
Show me your gem!
Amethyst!
Your gem is cracked!
How did this even happen?
Of course...
How could I have been so blind?
We need to put a fence up there, so this will never happen again!
It'd be fine if it was just her body, but her gem is damaged.
Before... we had Rose.
Just today, you were crying about snakes.
And in the center of the garden, Rose's Fountain, overflowing with your mother's healing, lacrimal essence!
Wha...
Now, now!
Let's keep it together!
Our memories of Rose can't be tainted by some overgrown brambles!
Look at them.
They're a mess without her guidance.
Directionless, pathetic, clinging things.
It's going to be okay, Garnet.
Y-you really think so?
Hmm...
Maybe there's a path over here!
Amethyst, no more roughhousing, you'll exacerbate your crack!
Ohh!
Oh!
Keep calm.
What we need to do is to get you into the fountain immediately, if we can ever find a way through all this mess!
We could've probably gotten in without hurdling a giant rock into Rose's most precious sanctuary!
But if you're okay with it, I'm fine, too!
What?
W-what's wrong with it?
Steven, it's fine.
Just— just stay here and watch Amethyst.
We'll find out what's wrong with the fountain.
Oh, thank goodness.
I'm pretty sure me and Garnet unplugging the clogged chamber brought the fountain back to life.
So, how do we begin our "school"?
Teach you?!
Steven!
If only I had known that's what you really wanted!
We found this Gem-powered mirror at the Galaxy Warp.
It can capture and display any event it's witnessed in all of Gem history.
It'll offer you everything you've ever wanted to know about your fellow Gems and our culture.
It's just you in there.
It hasn't even been activated.
Show us the Galaxy Warp...
Show us the Galaxy Warp.
Oh, come on!
I know you've seen it.
It is in pretty rough shape.
It must finally be broken.
What a shame.
Oh well.
I guess that's the end of our school.
Yes.
Good, Steven.
There are many ways to say the same thing.
The asymmetry of this pile is really starting to bother me.
Hello, Steven.
You don't understand.
Symmetrical means both sides have to be the same!
Oh, gosh!
Excellent work, Steven!
Wait.
What?
It's talking to him?
It shouldn't be able to do that.
I-it should just be following orders...
Garnet, wait!
I'm sure he didn't understand what he was doing!
Steven!
Steven, run!
Steven!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yes, you're grounded!
She's the Gem you released from the mirror.
There's a lot you don't know about Gems, Steven.
How could I have known the Gem contained in that mirror would be so powerful?
Clearly, we're coming too.
We're always fighting Gems, actually.
Oh, how do I put this?
All Gems aren't necessarily... good.
Yes.
But they've become corrupted and broken.
We have to take care of them, subdue them, contain them.
It's the best we can do for them, for now.
If we don't, then... 
I don't understand.
What does she want with the ocean?
Greg, kids, you stay behind us.
We'll handle this.
I hate fighting me.
Well, what's that thing you always say about the pork chops and the hot dogs?
What does this mean for us?
Wow.
Those water constructs really did a number on Greg's van.
I completely disagree.
It's just a simple human machine.
I'm sure that I can figure this whole thing out before you know it!
Is it some kind of complex human tool?
I'm sure that I can fix this without your tape.
 Yes!
Oh, right, yes!
You fix Greg, I'll fix the van, nobody has to live with us.
Steven, don't worry about it.
Your powers are a bit fickle, after all.
Garnet, can you give me a hand?
What? 
Now, Greg, there's no need to be so pathetic.
If anything happens to you, you can call us with this.
What you're looking at is a synthetic storm that was caused and contained in—
Is everything okay?
Like I was saying, this is a synthetic—
Okay, so if the Geode breaks, then the storm will be unleashed and our bodies will be vaporized. 
We'll find another way!
We have to come up with another plan, quick. 
So, I've realigned the axles, replaced the spark plugs, sealed the leaks in the intake manifold gaskets, and recalibrated the timing belt.
As long as you ease up on second gear, your transmission should be fine.
Inactive.
Well, Steven, these warp pads were used to travel off-planet.
They were our connection to the Gem Homeworld and to Gem-controlled planets all over the universe.
It's true.
The galaxy warps have all been inactive for thousands of years.
It's fine.
I'll always have my memories of other worlds.
But now I'm here... on Earth... forever.
Right.
With you.
It really is incredible out there, though.
I wish you could see it, Steven.
"UUU space travel"?
What is this?
A spaceship?
A spaceship.
Aah!
I think your calculations may have been off.
Did you really think this was gonna work?
Here, look.
You need smooth, curving surfaces.
Otherwise, you're never gonna get enough speed to break Earth's gravitational pull.
Probably swept-back wings for supersonic flight, airtight cockpit with ejector seat, and we'll need some serious engines, or maybe rockets would be better.
What?!
This?
Of course not.
That would be ridiculous.
I mean, yes, theoretically, it's not a stretch.
You've got plenty of spare parts here, albeit for incredibly primitive propulsion-based space travel.
The idea is ludicrous.
It would never work, although several humans, a monkey, and a dog did make it into space.
I don't know why I've never even thought of it before.
This could actually work!
I hear what you're saying, and I agree— it would be incredibly dangerous ; a fool's errand.
This chair is disgusting.
But aren't the true fools the ones who don't seize an opportunity, despite all the inherent risks?
And I'd be able to show Steven the wonders of the cosmos!
And maybe just for a second, from a distance, I could see what's been going on without me.
All right!
Let's do it!
We're not even close to being done.
Okay, Steven.
Go ahead and bring her down.
Don't worry.
This was just to test my engine concept.
I'll work out the kinks in the next one.
Is there a shop in town that carries F-1 single-nozzle liquid-fueled rockets?
Of course!
We're also going to need a space suit for Steven so he doesn't freeze or explode.
Yes, I am.
Hey!
Who made you C.E.O.?!
Fine.
If neither of you will help, I'll just do it by myself, not like it'll be much different.
Shh!
Want to see something really cool?
Presenting the brand-new ballistic-flight-capable Universe Mach 3!
Wait, Steven.
Keep your voice down.
And if your dad asks, we'll say we borrowed it.
If you want, Steven, we could take her out for an engine check.
It'll be quick.
This will be perfectly fine, just a pop over to the nearest star system.
I'll give him back in 50 years.
Oh, this is so exciting!
Steven, you're gonna love it.
Hang on tight!
We can make it.
We're almost there.
I'm gonna show it to you.
Steven!
What are you doing?!
But we're almost there!
I'm so sorry.
I almost got us killed.
You know, I think I'd rather be here on Earth.
Yeah.
With you.
What are you doing in here?!
I... just wanted to see how the shards are reacting to Rose's bubble.
And it's none of your business.
Don't tell her!
Heathen!
Steven, be careful with that!
She's not going to find out...
We're going to catch them, all of them.
Like nothing ever happened.
No!
This has to stay a secret.
Okay?
Fish Stew Pizza?
Greeaat, Steven.
Come on. We're doing this.
Okay.
Are you sure we didn't miss any?
If you're sure this is all of them, then we just need to seal it in a Rose Quartz bubble.
Of course you can!
You're part of the Secret Club!
Ah, yes, Secret Team.
Then what are you waiting for?
Mission accomplished.
Congratulations, us.
Now everything goes back to normal and we never speak of this again.
I've never seen you wear this.
Secret Team?
What's that?!
Steven, that was not about fun.
That was about fixing our terrible mistake.
It never would have popped if you hadn't invaded my personal space!
Good!
I don't want to be on a team with you, either!
Fine!
Garnet!
Steven!
Steven...
I can't believe you!
Amethyst, shape-shift!
Get small or... something!
I can't concentrate!
This is all my fault!
I never should have had that bubble!
What?
Are you sure it's here?
Do you think it swam away?
Alright.
You did great.
Amethyst!
That's not funny!
Regardless, we need to warp back out.
And you do need air to breathe.
I guess, but--
What on Earth?!
Care to explain what's going on here?
Oh, please.
Steven, don’t slam the door!
Why?
That must be from when we fought those drill parasites on the beach.
Aww, it’s the flowers from Rose's moss.
Well, yeah, obviously.
What’s wrong, Steven?
Oh, Steven.
Humans just lead short, boring, insignificant lives, so they make up stories to feel like they're a part of something bigger.
They want to blame all the world's problems on some single enemy they can fight, instead of a complex network of interrelated forces beyond anyone's control.
Don't feel bad about it, okay?
It's not like he was ever going to be right.
Steven, where are you going?
We know you have our Steven!
Why does it have to be dinner?
We get all the energy we need from our gems, and while our human constructs are capable of eating, I find it very uncomfortable.
Uh...
What?!
Steven, you know we only fuse in deadly situations!
Steven!
Ohh.
Thank you so much.
You don't know how horrified I was when that dreck nearly fell into our mouths.
Eating food is so disgusting!
You chew it into nasty mush, swallow that goop, and it comes out of you?
What a completely horrid experience!
What were you thinking, running off with Connie like that?
You could have gotten yourselves hurt!
Steven, you are in very big trouble, and we have no choice but to punish you.
We would never starve you, but you will lose your TV privileges... for 1,000 years.
I suppose...
Your mother had the power to grow sentient plant life to act as her defenders.
You said they're hurting people?
He can't control them.
Steven-
Get in the house.
Now!
Let go of my spear, you little twerps!
I'll destroy you!
Steven!
Oh my gosh!
Hang on! I got you!
Ugh, Lion!
Let him go!
Steven, are you all right?
Why was Lion sleeping on top of you?
Me?
Nothing.
I was just uh... well, you know how I always say... um, I just uh... I like to watch you sleep sometimes.
And by sometimes I mean often.
And he keeps sleeping on Steven's face!
But Steven doesn't want me watching him anymore.
So one of you two has to do it.
I can't believe that went so well!
And the way you were circling around it?
Almost looked like strategy.
Oh, Steven, you're supposed to sneeze into your antecubital fossa.
Your... this thing.
Steven, your fossa! 
Oh!
Careful!
It's dangerous to stick your head out of the stream! 
What?
Steven, that's not possible.
Is your vision blurry from the pollen?
Steven, we've got a surprise for you...
Gah!
Oh, Steven!
This isn't about the thing you think you saw outside the warp stream yesterday, is it?
Listen.
Nothing on Earth can use the warps but us.
Do you understand?
Steven, nod in agreement if you understand.
Nod in agreement—
Nothing here, either.
And the geode is holding nicely.
We've looked all over!
There's nothing out here to find! 
Excuse me?!
Nothing on Earth can use these warps but us!
I-... don't appreciate your tone.
These are the warps that once connected us to other planets.
If something tried to come from space, it would be through here.
But wait!
This warp pad is broken, marked inactive by the very depressed cartoon breakfast sticker you placed here yourself! 
Yes, Steven feels much better now.
And I know you didn't!
You don't tell me what I already know!
Steven, you just don't know what you're talking about.
Ugh! 
Steven, are you okay?!
Amethyst heard the Warp Pad activate, and Garnet said you were floating outside the stream and uh...
What is that?
What are they doing to the Homeworld warp?!
I... don't know!
Who is that?
They're coming back!
I can't do this!
Not again!
Synchronize!
Be serious!
Pay attention now, Steven.
See?
Nobody expects you to be able to perform fusion right away, Steven.
We'll keep working on the dance for now, and who knows, in a few years...
I wonder though if Steven's body is capable of fusion.
Fusion merges the physical forms of gems, but Steven is half-human.
He's organic.
He fused?
With his friend Connie?
This is unprecedented.
A Gem fusing... with a human... being?
It's impossible!
Or at the very least inappropriate.
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves, but you two should un-fuse this instant.
Of... course I am!
I - Garnet, help me out here.
What?
I needed those for my bachelor meal combo.
Now I can't ring the dinner bell.
These rules make no sense.
What?
You have a baloney card?
Who wrote this game?
Yes, well done.
That was very, very complicated.
There are more?
Oh, Steven.
Oh, Steven, no, no, no. If the Spire had been crucial, we wouldn't have used it as a test for you.
It's fine, really.
Uhhhhhhh, well it wasn't really a "test", per se.
Not in the traditional sense.
We just wanted to see if you were ready to go on missions.
Oh, and you had that raft so we didn't have to swim home!
That's a solid 75, not failing at all!
Besides, that Spire was in much worse shape than we thought.
It should have been even easier.
That's not what I meant!
But Steven.
You've come so far.
Alright, Steven.
We've adjusted the metaphysical properties of the temple to create a customized dungeon for you.
Now, just beyond here are three chambers designed by each of us to simulate the challenges of a mission.
Should you succeed, you will unlock the final door, where we will be waiting for you.
That's the spirit!
I didn't think mine was very difficult.
Do you think he hurt himself?
The point is that he's come so far.
He can make Rose's bubble!
And he's pulled out Rose's shield twice.
But he's lost his healing powers.
We have to give him another "success".
He can't lose his confidence like that again.
What?!
But he needs us to show him how to be a Gem!
Congratulations, Steven!
Thank goodness you made it!
How did it... go?
Oh, Steven.
I'm so proud of you.
We're ready, Garnet.
Garnet!
Shouldn't we be going?
We can't have them reactivating and fixing the Homeworld Warp.
Amethyst, please!
This is serious!
We need to understand these things, not squash them.
If Homeworld Gems are trying to return to Earth...
They have to be stopped!
Steven, a very long time ago, Gems tried to do something... very bad.
It was something that would have damaged the Earth.
Some Gems, like your mother, Garnet, and myself, felt that this was unfair to the life that already existed here, and so we swore to never let the Earth be used for their... purposes.
Even if it meant-
Even if it meant we could never go home.
The wha--?
Steven, we are not like the no home boys.
We are literally standing in your home right now.
There you are.
Garnet said you'd be here, but I didn't want to believe it.
Amethyst, what were you thinking bringing Steven to a Kindergarten!?
How much did you tell him?
Amethyst, he's not ready!
That's enough!
Steven, I'm sorry.
I never wanted you to see this horrible place.
I don't want to fight you.
Amethyst, stop this!
You can't beat me.
Amethyst...
But-
Amethyst, I had no idea you've been upset about this.
No, no. Amethyst, you're not the mistake.
You're just the byproduct of a big mistake.
No, that's not- I... I just never thought of this as you.
None of this is your fault.
You didn't build this place.
I-I'm sorry, Amethyst.
I hope you can forgive me.
You're the one good thing that came out of this mess.
I always thought you were proud of that.
You all having a nice time?
This is too risky.
If the shooting star goes off mid-warp, it could explode forever in warp space.
And even if we do manage to destroy the entire Galaxy Warp, they could still find another way to get here.
Steven?!
Like this?
Why would she come with Greg?
Are they hanging out again?
Unbelievable!
They really are!
They used to disappear for days, watching those obnoxious tapes over and over and over.
Until...
I don't know.
One day, they just... stopped.
Happy New Year, Steven!
How's my volume?
Hello, Greg.
Nice of you to join us.
Well...
One of Peridot's Machines?
Yes I think so, only... we've never seen one this big before.
Amethyst, we need to be careful, we don't know what this stuff is.
Oh no!
Don't you dare get that stuff on me!
It's another one of those things!
Is it... looking for a warp?
We're not... really... that sure...
Stop! coming! here! you! stupid! balls!
We don't know!
They just keep coming and coming and we don't even know what they are!
We don't know anything!
But nobody knows what these things are here to do.
What?
Who knows what could go wrong?
Oh, why here?
This site has been damaged enough by the Gems that were incubated here 6,000 years ago!
That's it!
It's confirmed.
These things are up to no good!
Garnet?
What does it want here?
I don't like this at all...
I can't believe we're doing this.
What is all this?
Is she trying to re-activate the Kindergarten?
Doesn't she know it'll destroy all life on Earth?!
That's because we destroyed it.
Because we are the Crystal Gems!
We're still alive, and we're still the guardians of this planet and all its living creatures!
This was a site of a historic battle.
Every weapon here was left by a Gem over 5,000 years ago.
I don't like to disturb it, but Garnet said we can't just leave these lying around.
Why don't you look for one that's more... you?
You really need to train that thing better.
What's he got now?
That's the scabbard for Rose's sword!
Gimme!
Gimme!
Shoo, shoo.
That's right!
And I fought alongside her.
But we won!
Your mother led us to glorious victory!
The odds were against us, and our hearts were uncertain.
But we chose to fight alongside Rose, and here we made our stand against our Homeworld!
It's been ages...
What is it, Steven?
She was courageous, and brilliant, and beautiful...
Sometimes, you look so much like her.
Hey, Steven...
Maybe you should hold onto this...
That's just the scabbard, Steven.
It held your mother's sword.
Nothing else could fit so perfectly inside.
For all this time it's been... incomplete.
Can you keep a secret?
Shh!
It's a secret, even to Garnet and Amethyst.
Rose had a place that she kept hidden from all but me, but you have her gem.
That place is yours now, and I can show it to you!
Now it's just a three-hour hike that way, followed by a vertical climb at 90 degrees.
Think you can handle it?
I was your mother's sole confidant— for the words she could share with no one else, I was there to listen.
She had to, Steven!
It's the mark of a great leader, knowing just what to keep hidden from everyone you're trying to protect.
Everyone except me!
Welcome to Rose's Secret Armory!
Wha— ?
You must be thinking of someplace else, I'm the only other Crystal Gem that's witnessed the Armory's magnificence before now.
The lion?!
I know!
That's why I brought you here!
Now let me show you how you can access the artillery.
The Axes of Ages?
The Heretic's Anguish?!
The Quartizine Trio!
The Armor of the Fallen!
Her sword!
Your mother's sword!
It's a straight bladed saber that's pink with a red handle.
There are vines etched in the guard that connect to a rose-shaped pommel.
Huh?
Rose's sword, how did it get in there?
But how?
Does Lion have something to do with Rose?
But... Rose didn't have a lion.
No, Rose didn't have a lion, because if Rose had a lion I would have known about it!
But not from me, I was the one she told everything!
You can't understand how I feel, none of you had what we had!
What do you know?!
You've never even met her!
Leave me alone!
Get that thing away from me!
Go away!
Steven!
Sometimes, you even sound like her...
Do you remember this place?
Do you have any of her memories?
We were right here, over 5,000 years ago.
Yes?
But I want to!
But why would I ever want to go home, if you're here?
You're wonderful...
Everything I ever did, I did for her.
Now she's gone, but I'm still here.
Sometimes, I wonder if she can see me through your eyes.
What would she think of me now?
You don't have to yell, Steven, we're right here.
Oh!
Uh... of course.
What are the lightning bolts for?
What is it?!
Have the shirts come to life and possessed the bodies of their wearers?!
Are the shirts destroying the wearer's will to continue on in this mortal coil, thereby shutting down Beach City?!
Oh.
Steven, this sounds like a very abstract problem.
Absolutely.
Yes!
Why not dust off those conflict resolution skills?
It spoke to you?
Ugh, Amethyst, wait!
Amethyst!
Leave him be!
You don't know where he's been!
I'm very sorry about this... umm... you.
What should we do?
I don't know how to make him go away.
Excellent idea!
Humans should stay on the other side of the fence like the sign says.
You know this human?
Night... time?
What?
I can sing!
What?
It's the Wailing Stone!
It just activated on its own!
Stand back!
Ha, it worked, now we can get back to...
I haven't heard a Wailing Stone activate since we used them for the rebellion, and I've never heard it sound like that!
But who?
We've rounded up all the Wailing Stones on Earth, and we're not sending this message to ourselves.
Unless... Amethyst?!
Is this a prank?!
No, no, we should be hearing a voice.
Maybe this signal is too advanced for the Wailing Stone to process.
That would explain the distorted audio.
I don't know...
Flangers aside do you really think a signal like this is compatible with your analog devices?
But, it's not supposed to be music.
It's supposed to be a message!
What's happening, where's the signal?
I had a feeling this wouldn't work, there's just no way that Greg's equipment can interface with our ancient Gem technology.
What a waste of time.
Okay, go for it Garnet.
Okay Amethyst, try it now.
The battery is ready to go.
Is that it?
I can't believe my flipping eyes!
It's Peridot, she must be talking about Peridot.
What?
Hmm, this spot should be safe.
Amethyst, do you have the robonoid?
Amethyst, I just repaired that.
Okay, we have everything we need for the experiment and Steven is home fast asleeeep?!
Steven!
It's way past your bed time!
You should really go back to the house!
It's not a robot friend, it's a robot disruptor.
It should produce a localized energy blast so when Peridot shows up to... meet with us, we'll have something that can knock out all her robonoids.
Now stand back everyone!
Steven, that was not the point of the-
Alright, that was a start!
Now I'm going to need to take some parts out of the washing machine.
Steven, you might have to wear the same shirt for a while.
Coming!
Oh, can I help you?
Oh, don't worry about that, the power should be back on as early as tonight or as late as... never.
Yes?
Oh, don't be dramatic.
I saw humans get on fine without power for millennia.
You used to hunt and gather, ha ha, what happened to that?
Who knows what she's going to have?
We won't stand a chance against their weapons.
But, if we can just knock them out...
Of course.
Yes!
Cards.
Yes!
Like Early Man.
Oh, hey, Steven.
If I could just concentrate the -
And why would we need to do that?
Oh, well, yes.
Everything is fine.
The Light Cannons should be ready.
It's a ship.
We have to assume it's Peridot. 
What are you doing?!
Get out of here!
This is not a Gem-controlled planet!
Unhand him! 
Okay, ship.
Turn us around!
Oh no!
We were going to introduce you.
Garnet, your plan!
That could have gone... a lot worse.
Amethyst!
That's enough celebrating.
Garnet's right.
People are already coming back into town. 
You know... we did once have a fence.
Let's get a new one.
With barbed wire! 
You always say you'll be the crocodile, but you never commit!
Steven?
Why is your communication device making that sound?
So you're just going to ignore her, forever?
Oh!
Hello, Connie...
Nooo...
Uh...
I- I don't know.
I don't understand your human relationships.
So... uhm... goodbye!
And we need to start looking for Peridot's escape pod too, assuming she even made it to Earth.
I knew it!
That flare led us right to the escape pod!
We'll save you, humans!
I can't believe it.
Peridot's still inside.
Steven!
You found Peridot's escape pod and didn't come get us immediately!?
Wha—?
Maybe we have been a little hard on him.
You want me to do what?
You're awfully young to begin something like this.
But, I suppose I was only a few thousand years old when I began fighting alongside Rose Quartz.
Yes, Connie?
Oh... Okay...!
If that's how you feel... we should get started!
Hey, you two, this way!
This is an Ancient Sky Arena, Connie, where some of the first battles for Earth took place.
It was here that I became familiar with the human concept of being a knight, completely dedicated to a person and a cause.
This is what you must become, Connie; brave, selfless, loyal... a knight!
We begin with a bow, first to me, your teacher.
And now again, to your liege.
I hope you two are taking this seriously.
To begin, this Holo-Pearl will be your opponent.
Alright, everything begins with your stance.
You do it for him.
And you would do it again.
You do it for her, that is to say you'll do it for him.
Keep your stance wide, keep your body lowered.
As you're moving forward, balance is the key.
Right foot, left foot, now go even faster.
And as you're you moving backwards, keep your eyes on me.
Good.
Right.
Concentrate, don't you want him to live?!
Yes, but put your whole body into it!
Everything you have, everything you are, you've got to give on the battlefield.
When everything is chaos, and you have nothing but the way you feel, your strategy and a sword, you just think about the life you'll have together after the war.
And then you do it for her, that's how you know you can win.
You do it for her, that is to say you'll do it for him.
Deep down you know you weren't built for fighting, but that doesn't mean you're not prepared to try.
What they don't know is your real advantage.
When you live for someone, you're prepared to die.
True.
But you know that you can draw your sword and fight.
Good.
Yes, excellent!
You do it for her-
Okay, now do that again
You do it for her, And now you say-
Ah, right on time.
We have important training to do, Connie.
She's been making great strides, Steven.
She's going to be an asset to you.
Remember, Connie.
In the heat of battle, Steven is what matters.
You don't matter.
Now... let us begin!
Steven!
Steven, don't interfere.
She needs to take me on herself.
Wha—?
Enough!
No!
In a real battle, Steven won't be there to save you.
Steven, you don't know that!
You shouldn't be anywhere near the fight!
You're too important!
Yes, you are!
Why won't you just let me do this for you, Rose!?
I... I mean... let her... do this.
Why won't you let Connie do this... for you...
That's... enough for today.
Rose made me feel... like I was everything.
I see now, how deeply you care about each other.
That will make you both great knights!
Connie is practically an expert, so Steven, you have a lot of catching up to do.
Oh, I'm so excited!
I can't wait for the midair and underwater dueling exercises, it's going to be boodles of fun!
Aye-aye, Garnet!
Where's Amethyst?         
Listen, Frybo, magic beings are indeed drawn to us, but we were here long before Beach City even existed.         
Excuse me?         
But Garnet, we'll have to move all the bubbles, a-and what about Steven's things?         
I wonder how many people have seen this thing?         
I just really enjoy doing all of those things.
Garnet, you don't think Peridot would come looking for us, do you?
Do you think she's still going to try to reactivate it?
You've already seen them.
Well, you've seen them disabled.
If Peridot reactivates them, they'll pick up right where they left off, planting Gems in the crust of the Earth, where they'll incubate and suck the life right out of the ground.
We can't let Peridot restart Gem production here, if we do, the entire planet will become....
Coming!
Garnet, are you sure we should bring Steven?
This might be dangerous.
Well, nothing looks activated.
In fact, i-it doesn't look like anything's budged since the last time we were here.
There she is!
You're cornered!
Neither can she!
Get back here!
I'll help!
Garnet, we lost Peridot.
Her fingers were too fast for us.
Um...
What are these things?
Wha...
You're just a phase.
You know that, right?
Oh, of course you don't.
You don't know anything about Rose.
Listen, Mr. Universe.
Rose may find you charming, but that's only because you're human.
You're a novelty, at best.
Well, that's very simple!
Humans can't fuse!
Fusion is the ultimate connection between gems.
And you, are not, a gem!
Uhh, noo?
I don't think so.
What are they doing?
Why are they still dancing!?
I-it didn't work!
What!?
I think he's her favorite too.
Guh!
This isn't getting us anywhere.
I don't get tired, I get results.
Amethyst, stay focused!
For all we know, Lapis and Jasper's fusion could be right under our noses!
Ah!
Are—are you alright?!
Ugh, it feels like we've been searching for light years!
Guh!
And I'm sick of these... life diapers!
We should be out there, searching!
Not in here, not searching!
Fun?
But, Garnet, you couldn't possibly search the ocean by yourself!
Let me— uh, let us, help you!
We're a team!
I'll pass on the slumber pals.
Oh! Right.
Is... this right?
I get it now.
Am I doing it?
Okay.
Alright.
I'm sleeping now.
I'm sleeping.
How is this even supposed to work?!
Oh my goodness, Connie's going to be here any second now!
I can't believe it, your first school dance!
Let me just fix your tie, and—
Amethyst!
What did I tell you about riding that thing in the house?
Amethyst, I'm gonna get you!
Are you okay?
Well that doesn't make any sense.
Lapis is fused with Jasper at the bottom of the ocean.
Uh...
I don't think so.
Ah, hahahaha ha!
Oh, Rose, this is wonderful!
I'm just having so much fun spending time with you, Rose!
Forget about Greg!
Let's go travel the galaxy!
Uh... yes, Steven?
Oh, that's okay!
Dreams aren't real!
They're just "mixed up movies"!
Wait.
How do you know?
What did she say?
Is she still in control?
Steven, you could be using your dreams to connect with her mentally.
M-my dream?!
Ugh!
If I must...
So, in my dream, I was... wha?
Steven, it's okay, we're here.
That's pretty convincing.
The Classroom Gems!
What are Gems?
Welcome to Gem Classroom.
I'm Pearl, and today we're going to talk about what gems are.
Simplified down to our basic form, gems are, well, just gems.
Our bodies are actually projections generated by our gemstone.
Think of it like a hologram, but with mass.
Though gems are extraordinarily resilient, if they're seriously hurt, they will release their physical form.
And poof back to just their gem.
This way, they can most efficiently put all of their energy into regenerating themselves.
And when a gem is reduced to its gemstone, it can be contained in a bubble or trapped in an object, making it impossible to reform.
But don't worry.
As long as the gemstone isn't damaged, the Gem will be able to regenerate.
But, if a gem's gemstone is cracked—
And if a Gem's gem is shattered completely, they'll cease to be.
That's all for today's lesson.
That is a very good question.
The answer... is you!
Why don't you write an essay about what it's like to be yourself?
Class dismissed!
Hello, Steven!
Um, thank you. Greg...
Did you give Steven that instrument?
Amethyst!
It's true though.
If you could only know what we really are, when we arrived on Earth from out beyond your star.
We were amazed to find your beauty and your worth, and we will protect your kind, and we will protect your Earth.
And we will protect your Earth, and we will protect you!
I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz, and everything that she believed in!
It looks like Peridot somehow repaired the Communication Hub.
Well, at least some of it.
I'm right behind you.
Hang on, it's been such a long time...!
We were?
Oh, well that's good!      
Why don't we do that more often?       
Again?
Right.
Steven, where's Lion?
Amethyst, get your head out of the fridge! 
You know I am.   
Oh, this is no good! 
It's Peridot.
She must've fixed the Communication Hub again!
Garnet, it's the hub again. 
I can't believe Peridot is giving us so much trouble!
But it hardly matters, right Garnet?
We can disable this tower as many times as we need to, together!
Okay?
Okay.
I'm ready.
Are you ready? 
I-Is something the matter, Amethyst? 
What? 
I'm sorry...
I-It's just... so much fun being Sardonyx with you.
Wait!
Let me explain! 
It really was Peridot!
T-The first time... 
No!
No, no, no, no!
We just needed a reason to fuse!
I just wanted to share a few more victories with you! 
Garnet... 
Uh, looking for Peridot!
For a few days straight...
Steven, I know I might have... disappointed... all of you.
I know Garnet is very upset with me, but I'm going to prove to her that she can trust me again!
Oh!
Garnet!
I was just looking for Peridot!
She's bound to be somewhere, right?
Any new ideas?
I'm sorry...
You mean the Keystone state?
What?
Wonderful!
I'll make sure Amethyst knows that-
Fine!
Well... goodbye!
I just don't know why I keep-
Oh!
Uh-
You look like you all had fun!
Garnet, how are you?
She's speaking to me again...
Kind of.
Steven!
You're back.
Is there... something I can help you with?
How do you know William Dewey?
Wish I could say the same for myself...
When did you get so smart?
Hmm...
This isn't just boring.
It's historically inaccurate!
Who wrote this?
He wasn't even there!
But I was.
Well, for starters, "ruggedly handsome" seems rather generous.
Oookay.
There he is!
Hi, Steven!
You're so talented!
It is the east, and we are the Crystal Gems!
Greetings!
I am Pearl!
And I come to you as a messenger of the brilliant Rose Quartz!
We ask that you turn your ship around!
The land you're headed for is no walk in the park for your species.
I am a gem of many talents.
A dedication to fact is just one of them.
Oh, what's 200 years between friends?
You know...
I don't remember there being a campaign slogan at the end of that story.
Oh, aha!
Look!
I was right!
My plan worked perfectly!
And you'll never get away with this!
Prepare to be annoyed!
Wha—!?
That's it!
I'm taking her out!
Huh?
I got her, I got her, I got her!
Huh!?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Okay, I realize that was a bit of a fiasco.
But there's a silver lining to this!
Now we know for sure that we can track her every movement!
Whenever she uses the warp system, her escape pod will instantly detect exactly where she is.
It's only a matter of time until we catch her, and when we do, we'll be able to close this chapter and finally move on!
Right?
It's Peridot.
She's using the warps right now.
Look!
This is where she is.
We got her for sure this time.
If she thinks she's got the upper hand, then she's got another thing coming.
And that's us!
Ha!
She's desperate.
Look at this!
She's cornered herself in there!
We've got her just where we want her.
Excellent question, Steven!
What we see before us is an ancient interplanetary Gem vessel.
Homeworld Gems used these ships to travel across the cosmos and land here on Earth before the warp pads were built.
But these ships landed here so long ago that there's no way they can be functional.
Peridot's running out of options!
Ah, yes!
The task at hand!
No more dawdling, let's go get Peridot!
You're the dull one if you think you can fly this wreck!
No... !
Peridot!
I have to do something!
I can't believe I walked us right into Peridot's trap.
This is all my... fault?
Garnet...
I'm sorry!
Things weren't supposed to turn out this way.
That's not what I mean...
I really wanted to catch Peridot to make up for what I did...
I wanted to prove to you that... that everything could go back to normal...
Please!
Tell me!
How can I make you forgive me!?
I'm sorry!
I... I couldn't help myself!
But it's true!
No matter how hard I try to be strong like you... I'm just a Pearl.
I'm useless on my own.
I need someone to tell me what to do.
When we fuse, I can feel what it's like to be you.
Confident and secure, and complete.
You're perfect.
You're the perfect relationship, you're always together, I just... I wanted to be a part of that.
I understand. I can't give up anymore!
Only if you're okay with it.
Don't let her go!
It's okay, Steven.
Next time... we'll get the rest of her.
Right, Garnet?
There he is!
What happened?!
What on Earth?
So these weren't actually part of her body?
Come on, Steven.
Oh, I'm so glad this is finally over.
Oh, no you don't!
Should we tell her that's the bathroom?
How did she get out?
We bubbled her!
Steven!
Why would you do such a thing!?
What else did she tell you?
I really hate to say it, but unfortunately if she has information, she's more valuable to us like... this.
Well, yes.
What other option do we have?
Keep her outside on a leash?
Ha ha...
Hmm...
Right now?
But even if we do get her to come out of the bathroom...
We have her in our custody at least, even if the circumstances are less than optimal.
How important do you think this Cluster is?
We understand that Gem production was extremely damaging to the Earth, and we deeply regret our involvement in this process.
The era of Gem production on Earth is over, and while we've left scars, please know we've done everything we can to counteract the damage that was done to here!
I'm sure it's not granola.
Now Peridot, I'm sure we can reach some sort of agreement.
Perhaps a trade is in order?
I swear, Peridot is gonna crack any second now!
I've got your clods right here, you little-!
Don't worry, she's harmless without her limb enhancers.
Oh, hush up!
Steven! Are you alright?
What are you two doing here?
But how?
We'll need to build some sort of machine to take us to the center of the Earth, it'll have to-
Well, we mustn't waste time.
We need to start finding parts for this machine immediately.
All right.
What we have here in the barn should be adequate enough for us to get started.
First, I recommend we organize the component types and assemble a rough blueprint based off what we have available.
Ugh... sorry, Steven, it's a lovely drawing but it won't look like this.
Uh, what?
Excuse me, I am not leaving.
That's enough!
If we're going to work together, you're going to have to listen to me.
Well, yes, bu-
Nobody!
Now listen here, you tiny twerp!
In case you've forgotten, you're on our turf now!
And I didn't fight a thousand-year war for this planet's independence to take orders from the likes of you!
I'm as good at building things as you.
Better, even!
You mean like a competition?
Well, I can build one faster!
Mine's taller.
I win.
Ugh, let's just give it a rest!
That's it, we tied, we're the same, let's move on.
Well, have you ever seen a pearl do this!?
It's alright, guys!
I've got this.
That's right!
I am a pearl!
What you're saying may be true, but it doesn't matter!
I'm still gonna kick your butt!
Ah, I'm alright.
Oh... really?
Uh... I dunno...
You're holding it upside down.
They're called wheels.
I've finished drawing out the blueprints for the drill head.
Peridot, if you could come take a look at this.
Why did you give her that?
Oh, good.
Hmm...
No...
No, no, no, no, I said I needed tungsten.
Tungsten?
Ugh... never mind.
I'll just do it.
Peridot, if you can get the magnetron out of that microwave, we'll have everything we need... except for the drill head.
Oh, well, I guess that's something you could try.
Oh, it's lovely!
To think we'd be using the same technology that started all this to fix it!
This drill is pure irony!
Ugh, another one of her temper tantrums.
I'm surprised you two made it back from the Kindergarten without driving each other crazy!
We leave for one second and everything goes off the rails!
No, it's fine, it's fine.
We'll rebuild it!
Stronger, better.
We'll add seat belts!
Steven, are you ready to go on the mission?
Ooooh, alright.
Well, have fun with your bag!
Don't let it into the house!
No!
Steven!
Steven!
Stop filming and help-
Fusion is very difficult to do.
Gems must be in perfect sync physically, mentally, and emotionally.
I'm great at collaborating!
We are the Crystal Gems!
Uh... bye!
It's you!
The fusion...
Peridot will keep us on schedule.
He certainly has.
Oh my.
Steven... are you feeling okay?
Here it comes!
Nice, Connie.
If you hit it, you get it.
Aw... Steven's having fun.
He turned back into a baby?!
Oh, no, no, don't give him to me!
Unbelievable.
Life and death and love and birth and peace and war on the planet Earth.
No no, that was several weeks ago.
There's a Diamond Base that may hold that information, but getting there is going to be difficult.
Because it's not accessible by warp pad.
And it's on...
Yes, Steven, the moon.
We made it.
Amethyst, please!
Don't blow us into space!
But where is the cluster now?
That's it then, mission accomplished!
We are looking at it.
Rose Quartz believed all life was precious, and worth protecting.
Well, with the new coordinates we got from the moon base, it should be ready to go.
But we really should perform a few tests first.
She took a direct line to the Diamonds!
From the moon base?
What was she thinking?
Look on the bright side.
At least you got this thing away from her before she did any real damage.
Ah!
Ah!
Where's Steven?
That's right.
You can feel horrible all you want back at the temple.
Ugh, not all pearls know each other Steven.
Yellow...
Why?
How do we stop it?!
Here Amethyst.
And then you insulted her to her face.
Amethyst, really, this is no time to be fooling around.
Heh, yes well at least she isn't lion around anymore, heheh.
Okay, we can add more support as we go, but for now we just have to pick it up and put it on top.
You've got the right idea, but we might wanna be a bit more careful.
Malachite?!
Who knows what sort of destruction an unstable fusion like Malachite could cause!
To the nearest warp pad!
Steven, is that you in there?
Be careful, Steven.
Watch each other's backs.
You look happy!
Uh, did you destroy the cluster?
What?
How on Earth did you bubble that whole thing?!
Steven!
Are you alright?
We saw the ship and came as fast as we could.
Oh, honestly, you call everyone a clod.
Ruby!
Sapphire!
We saw.
Baseball?!
Earl!
Nice!
Uh-oh...
What?
What are you all doing!?
Steven is falling; he needs our help.
I'll catch you, Steven!
Steven!
Are you okay?
Steven, try falling a little faster.
He's clearly very tired from being up all night, and he's eager to get some sleep.
Maybe we can weigh him down?
Sorry, Steven.
But if he can't control his power-
How is it all right!?
I would've liked a hug.
What is this?
This is what did it?
Burgers?
She would have loved it.
I don't know, past experiences have taught me that three's a crowd.
I must admit.
It's a perfect fit.
And those fountains I found wasteful, are actually quite tasteful.
This city's got its charms, unlike that termite ridden barn.
And any time with Steven makes for a delightful evening.
More or less.
No!
I mean, maybe later...
I was fine, with the men, who would come into her life now and again.
I was fine, cause I knew, that they never really mattered until you.
I was fine, when you came, and we fought like it was all some silly game.
Over her, who she'd chose.
After all these years I never thought I'd lose.
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?
You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone.
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
War and glory, reinvention, fusion, freedom, her attention.
Out in daylight, my potential, bold, precise, experimental.
Who am I now in this world without her?
Petty and dull with the nerve to doubt her.
What does it matter?
It's already done!
Now I've got to be there for her son!
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?!
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?!
You won and she chose you and she loved you and she's gone!
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?
Greg!
You were... awake?
Greg!
I shouldn't have come along.
I don't hate you.
That wasn't the problem.
She fell in love with you.
She always did what she wanted.
Dancing with you.
Why'd we even come?
We could've done this at home.
Singin' a song, don't cost nothin'.
Or was it, palling around, don't cost nothin'.
Getting it wrong!
I tried.
What can I say?
It's catchy.
Hello, gentlemen. May I take your order?
Order taken.
And for you?
Our only dishes.
Here's your order, sir.
And for you, sir.
Sorry, no additions or substitutions.
